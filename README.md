User Stories:

- As a market team, I want 3 random pictures of products to be displayed simultaneously together in the browser to enable particiapants to choose one of the three products that they are most likely to purchase.

- As a market team, I want to make sure none of the three products shown in one browser windows selection choice come up again immediatley following in the next set of three products.

-As a market team, I want the number of choices (or clicks) that a particular product recieves to be stored, be accessible for calculations, and to be visually displayed in another part of the site that is innaccessible to the particiapant until a specific condition is meant.

- As a market team, after a total of 15 choices(clicks) has been reached, not for a particular product, but overall, I want the user to be given a choice to review his answers or to continue with the product research test untill another 15 choices has occured and continue this process until the particiapant agrees to review his answers.

- As a developer, I want to put all images into a directory that can be accessed easily from within my code.

- As a developer, I want to make a function that gives a random number from 1 to the number of images in the directory, and also make sure that this random number generator does not generate the same random number twice in a row.

- As a developer I want to display 3 random images picked with the random numbers side by side.

- As a developer, when clicked, I want the click to be stored in a variable for the particular image that is clicked so I can keep track of the number of clicks a particular picture has recieved.

- As a developer I want to resize my pictures so that when displayed inline in a row, they are equal in size and shape, and they are organized accordingly.

- As a developer I want to visually display all pictures and text and information in such a way that is visually appealing to the particiapant, and data that is easily accessed understandable by the market team.

- As a developer, I want my site/app to be visually appealing to the senses.

- As a developer, I want to visually display all the information of number of clicks for each product on a seperate page only accessible after 15 clicks AND with a yes choice from the particiapant, and repeat 15 more times over and over again until every 15th tim, the user finally agrees to review their answers.

- As a particiapant, I want to be using a visually appealing site.

- As a particiapant, I want the instructions to be on the page and be very clear cut so that I understand exactly how to accomplish the marketing test correctly.

- As a particiapant, I want to eventually be able to see the results of the test.
